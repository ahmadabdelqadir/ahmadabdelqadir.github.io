# Introduction

There is a wide variety of types when it comes to Astrophotography, starting from Milky Way wide-angle photography to Deep Sky Astrophotography with a Telescope. They all have many things in common and require understanding some concepts. For example : Long Exposure Images, Image Stacking, and Image Processing in general.
In this website, i will discuss and explian how can you start imaging the night sky with a DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) or a Mirrorless Camera. I will also be providing some brief scientific background behind some concepts.

## Understanding basic concepts

### DSLR Camera Settings:

### Aperture: 

Aperture can be defined as the opening in a lens through which light passes to enter the camera. It is an easy concept to understand if you just think about how the human eyes work. As you move between bright and dark environments, the iris in your eyes either shrinks or expands respectively, controlling the size of the pupil.

In photography, the “pupil” of the lens is called aperture. You can shrink or enlarge the size of the aperture to allow more or less light to reach the camera sensor. In cameras, the aperture is represnted as the "f-stop" number, which is the focal length of the lens divided by the aperture. The image below shows the difference between different apertures of a lens:

As you can see, the lower the f-stop the bigger the opening in the lens, the more light enters the camera. 

### Shutter Speed:

Shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time that the digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light (that is, when the camera's shutter is open) when taking a photograph. The amount of light that reaches the image sensor is proportional to the exposure time. For example: 1⁄500 of a second will let half as much light in as 1⁄250.

We can see that the less the shutter speed is, the more we get close to freezing the movement of the subject.

### ISO:

ISO is simply a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. As you increase your ISO number, your photos will grow progressively brighter. For that reason, ISO can help capture images in darker environments, or be more flexible about your aperture and shutter speed settings.

However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too high of an ISO will show a lot of grain, also known as noise. So, brightening a photo via ISO is sometimes a trade-off. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or aperture instead.

We can see that the lower image has more noise due to having a High ISO value.



### How do we use these settings when photographing the night sky?

When photographing the night sky, We aim to let as much light reach the camera sensor as we can. This can be done by increasing the shutter speed or as known as the exposure time. It can be done by lowering the F-Stop, or increasing the ISO too. However, On one hand, camera lenses and telescopes have limited F-stop numbers, and at night, lowering the F-stop number to its lowest value may not be enough. On the other hand, if we increase the ISO too much, it might introduce too much noise in the image, which is something we do not want.
