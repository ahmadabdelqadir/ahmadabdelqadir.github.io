Polar alignment is an essential first step towards a night of astrophotography. By aligning the axis of your telescope mount with the motion of the sky, you can accurately track objects in space. It’s a rather simple process for a German equatorial mount.

The same process applies to a portable star tracker and is completed via the built-in polar finder scope. An accurate polar alignment is essential for all types of long exposure astrophotography.

## Finding The North Star - Polaris

To start out, roughly align the telescope mount in the direction of the North Celestial Pole.  This can be accomplished by physically moving your tripod and mount, and aiming the polar axis in a general North direction. Polaris can be spotted in the sky quite easily, as it is much brighter than any surrounding stars in it's area.

In case you did not succeed at finding Polaris, use a free planetarium software such as Stellarium to help you learn the night sky and its constellations from your location. The mobile version of Stellarium can help you find Polaris when you are outside under the stars.  It offers a live-view overlay of the night sky to confirm the constellations and stars you are observing.

## Leveling the Tripod

Make sure that the tripod of your telescope mount is as levelled as possible. An uneven tripod will result in an inaccurate position of your mount in relation to the altitude scale. Many german equatorial mounts have a bubble level built-in which help level the tripod.

##### Note: It is important to note that the tripod needs to be pointing North before leveling.  

## Adjusting The Latitude

This is the coordinate we will use to adjust the position of the telescope mount to align with the North celestial pole.  The telescope mount should have a latitude scale posted on one side, with an indicator of what latitude your mount is currently in line with.  You will need to adjust the mount to your current latitude using its altitude adjustment bolts.

## Positioning Polaris In the Polar Scope

A mobile app such as PolarFinder will tell you the exact spot to position the North Star for a near-perfect polar alignment.  

The app uses your mobile device’s GPS to automatically calculate the position of Polaris for your latitude and longitude. It will display the correct position of Polaris in relation to the North celestial pole.

You will then simply mimic this location by adjusting in your mount's Azimuth and latitude bolts.

Android users can download PolarFinder, and iPhone users have Polar Scope Align Pro.

#### After Adjusting The Azimuth and Altitude Knobs on the mount to place Polaris in the correct place, you are all set and Polar Aligned.
