## Equipment for wide-field Milky Way Photography

1.Full-Frame or APS-C DSLR Camera

The usual advice for photographing the night sky is to get a camera with the best possible high ISO noise performance. Theoretically, you can take top-quality deep-sky and also Milky Way photos with any DSLR camera as long as it has manual mode and is able to shoot in raw format.

2.A Telescope or a Camera Lens with high Focal length

3.A Tracking Mount with a steady Tripod

In order to take deep space images, we need to take long exposure images of the object we are trying to photograph in order to let as much photons as we can into the camera sensor. However, duo to the earth rotation, when taking a long exposure, the stars in the image are going to move, which leads to ugly star trails in the image. Thats why we use a tracking mount in order to track the motion of the earth and keep the stars in place.

5.A star tracker for widefield Night Sky images

One of the best accessories for capturing high-quality photos of the night sky is a star tracking head. To use it, you just point the head at the North Star – or equivalent area in the Southern Hemisphere – and it follows the rotation of the stars all night (technically the rotation of the Earth). You can attach an ordinary tripod head and compose your photo however you want. Wherever you point, star trails will be eliminated since we are tracking their movement, which can let us use a higher exposure time for each photo.

However, the downside is that “earth trails” – i.e., a blurred foreground – is inevitable when you use a star tracker. Some photographers choose to take a second, non-tracked photo of the foreground and merge the two together in Photoshop or any other capable software. Other photographers use star tracking heads for deep-sky astrophotography anyway and don’t have a foreground to worry about in the first place.

6.An Intervalometer (Remote Shutter Release)

Many photographers take several exposures in order to stack them on top of each other in post processing in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and produce a cleaner image (this procedure is explained in the procedure section). In order to let the camera to take several photos at the same exposure time we connect the intervalometer with the correct settings and we're all set.

Another advantage for the intervalometer is that we don't have to touch the camera and move it slightly each time we need to take another photo, which allows the whole setup to stay steady and produce sharp stars in the images.

### Software

1.DeepSkyStacker (DSS)

With the proper software, you can load multiple photos of the DeepSpace Object to be averaged together, a process which drastically reduces noise and improves image quality.

One of the best options is DeepSkyStacker which is free. The software will align the stars before averaging your photos and produces a cleaner image with less noise.

2.Adobe Photoshop / Siril / Pixinsight

After stacking a DeepSpace Image, the stacked image is most-likely going to be dark. In order to reveal the hidden details, we stretch the Histogram of the Image to make it brighter and reveal faint details.
