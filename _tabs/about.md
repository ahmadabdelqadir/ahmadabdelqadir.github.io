I am Ahmad Abd El Qadir, a computer science student and an Astronomy enthusiast.
I created this Website to share what i've learnt about DSLR astrophotography in the past year and a half. I also aim to help beginners figure out "hidden" information about different kinds of topics that I personally struggled figuring out.

This website will always be under development and will be an easy place for any beginner to find his way into this hobby.
